# 4. Execution of Network Commands

## AIM  
Use of network commands in a real-time environment.

## Software  
- Command Prompt  
- Network Protocol Analyzer

## Procedure  
To do this experiment, follow these steps:

Students have to understand basic networking commands such as:

- `tcpdump`
- `netstat`
- `ifconfig`
- `nslookup`
- `traceroute`

Additionally, capture **ping** and **traceroute** PDUs using a **network protocol analyzer**.

This includes all commands related to **network configuration**, such as:

- Switching to **privileged mode** and **normal mode**
- Configuring **router interfaces**
- Saving the configuration to **flash memory** or **permanent memory**

### This includes the following commands:

- Configuring the router commands  
- General commands to configure network  
- Privileged mode commands of a router  
- Router processes & statistics  
- IP commands  
- Other IP commands (e.g., `show ip route`)
